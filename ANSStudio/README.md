# Approximate Number System Studio

Approximate Number System (ANS) Studio is a set of MATLAB scripts that creates stimulus used for studying the ANS (see e.g., Hallberda, Mazzocco, & Feigenson, 2008). The particular scripts included have been used to create stimulus materials and run experiments in a number of studies on adults (e.g., Lindskog,Winman, & Juslin, 2013) and infants (e.g., Schröder et al., 2021). 

Before running any stimulus creation or experiments, make sure to run ANSprereq to put all relevant folders on the MATLAB path. The Demo folder contains an ExperimentDemo and a StimulusDemo written to get you started with using ANS studio.

The scripts are provided under MIT license "as is". Please feel free to fork and develop for your own specific research needs.
