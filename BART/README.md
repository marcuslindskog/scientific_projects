# Balloon Analogue Risk Task

The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) is a computerized task used to measure risk taking in diverse population.
The BART was originally developed by Lejuez and colleagues and is described in Lejuez et al. (2002, 2007).
This implementation of the BART, in Python, was used to investigate risk taking in 10-year-olds with ADHD. 
The data collected with the task has not been published.
